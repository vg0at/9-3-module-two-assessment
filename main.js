// To ensure Cypress tests work as expeded, add any code/functions that you would like to run on page load inside this function

function run() {
    console.log(section)
 // Add code you want to run on page load here
}

// This function will "pause" the functionality expected on load long enough to allow Cypress to fully load
// So that testing can work as expected for now
// A non-hacky solution is being researched

setTimeout(run, 1000);
